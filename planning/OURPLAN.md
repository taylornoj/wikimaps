# Wiki Maps - a Midterm Project

The following work was completed on day one of our project.  We worked collaboratively on the ERD of our database as well as wireframes of our page views.

## User Stories

The first task to complete in our planning was to establish user stories.  User stories helped us to better understand what our apps function will be and how the user will interact with our app.  Writing user stories also helped us to build our ERD and in turn, allowed us to develop the flow of our app.

## The ERD

## The Wireframes 

Although our final project did include additional pages and our 'Create a Map' page ended up looking differently than the wireframe, the layout of our final pages are consistent and user friendly.
