# WikiMaps 

Welcome to Wiki Maps, an application where users can explore the world, one map at a time! Want to know the top five restaurants in Toronto? Maybe you want to share the top ten best green spaces in Ottawa? You can view maps others have made and even create your own!

When you visit our site, users first see the Browse Maps page where you can explore maps others have made and read the description of each.

Once a user is logged in, they can see a list of maps that they have created. Here you will see that each card has added functionality with an edit, favourite and delete button.

Users can edit their map with any new information. They can change the title and description of their map or even change the location of the marker.

If you have an idea for a new map, head to the Create a New Map button to start from scratch.  Users can enter a catchy title to draw other users in and a description so users know what to expect when they open the map. Users can enter the longitude and latitude to place the marker on the exact location of their choice.

After completing their map, users are then returned to their profile and see an updated list of their maps!
